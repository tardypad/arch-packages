# Termite

Initial source [Arch Linux](https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/termite)

Modified to be patched to keep using the deprecated (but still working) geometry option.  
Until using Sway 1.0 which hopefully will make it not required: 
resizing floating windows via rules with criteria should be enough
