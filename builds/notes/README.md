# Notes

Initial source [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=notes-git)

Modified to use released version and set the autocompletions and man pages

We need to use notes-git as a name instead of notes
because notes is already used by another package...
which would create an issue when checking for updates
