# Notes

Initial source [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree?h=notes-git)

Modified to use released version and set the autocompletions and man pages

We need to use notes-pimterry as a name instead of notes
to prevent issues when checking for AUR updates:
- notes is already used by another package
- notes-git (as this package is named in AUR) doesn't follow same release version naming
